[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mgrep  [22msearches the named input [4mFILE[24ms for lines containing a match to the given [4mPATTERN[24m.  If no files are specified, or if the file ‚Äú[1m-[22m‚Äù is given, [1mgrep[0m
       searches standard input.  By default, [1mgrep [22mprints the matching lines.

       In addition, the variant programs [1megrep [22mand [1mfgrep [22mare the same as [1mgrep -E [22mand [1mgrep -F[22m, respectively.  These variants are deprecated, but are provided
       for backward compatibility.

       [1m-E[22m, [1m--extended-regexp[0m
              Interpret [4mPATTERN[24m as an extended regular expression (ERE, see below).

       [1m-F[22m, [1m--fixed-strings[0m
              Interpret [4mPATTERN[24m as a list of fixed strings (instead of regular expressions), separated by newlines, any of which is to be matched.

       [1m-G[22m, [1m--basic-regexp[0m
              Interpret [4mPATTERN[24m as a basic regular expression (BRE, see below).  This is the default.

       [1m-P[22m, [1m--perl-regexp[0m
              Interpret  the  pattern  as  a  Perl-compatible  regular expression (PCRE).  This is highly experimental and [1mgrep -P [22mmay warn of unimplemented
              features.

   [1mMatching Control[0m
       [1m-e [4m[22mPATTERN[24m, [1m--regexp=[4m[22mPATTERN[0m
              Use [4mPATTERN[24m as the pattern.  If this option is used multiple times or is combined with the [1m-f [22m([1m--file[22m) option, search for all patterns  given.
              This option can be used to protect a pattern beginning with ‚Äú-‚Äù.

       [1m-f [4m[22mFILE[24m, [1m--file=[4m[22mFILE[0m
              Obtain  patterns  from [4mFILE[24m, one per line.  If this option is used multiple times or is combined with the [1m-e [22m([1m--regexp[22m) option, search for all
              patterns given.  The empty file contains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.

       [1m-i[22m, [1m--ignore-case[0m
              Ignore case distinctions in both the [4mPATTERN[24m and the input files.

       [1m-v[22m, [1m--invert-match[0m
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

       [1m-w[22m, [1m--word-regexp[0m
              Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.  The test is that the matching substring must either be at the beginning  of
              the  line,  or  preceded  by  a non-word constituent character.  Similarly, it must be either at the end of the line or followed by a non-word
              constituent character.  Word-constituent characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.   This  option  has  no  effect  if  [1m-x  [22mis  also
              specified.

       [1m-x[22m, [1m--line-regexp[0m
              Select  only  those  matches that exactly match the whole line.  For a regular expression pattern, this is like parenthesizing the pattern and
              then surrounding it with [1m^ [22mand [1m$[22m.

       [1m-y     [22mObsolete synonym for [1m-i[22m.

   [1mGeneral Output Control[0m
       [1m-c[22m, [1m--count[0m
              Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.  With the [1m-v[22m, [1m--invert-match [22moption  (see  below),  count
              non-matching lines.

       [1m--color[22m[[1m=[4m[22mWHEN[24m], [1m--colour[22m[[1m=[4m[22mWHEN[24m]
              Surround  the  matched  (non-empty) strings, matching lines, context lines, file names, line numbers, byte offsets, and separators (for fields
              and groups of context lines) with escape sequences to display them in color on the terminal.   The  colors  are  defined  by  the  environment
              variable  [1mGREP_COLORS[22m.   The  deprecated  environment variable [1mGREP_COLOR [22mis still supported, but its setting does not have priority.  [4mWHEN[24m is
              [1mnever[22m, [1malways[22m, or [1mauto[22m.

       [1m-L[22m, [1m--files-without-match[0m
              Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which no output would normally have been printed.   The  scanning  will
              stop on the first match.

       [1m-l[22m, [1m--files-with-matches[0m
              Suppress  normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which output would normally have been printed.  The scanning will stop
              on the first match.

       [1m-m [4m[22mNUM[24m, [1m--max-count=[4m[22mNUM[0m
              Stop reading a file after [4mNUM[24m matching lines.  If the input is standard input from a regular file, and [4mNUM[24m matching  lines  are  output,  [1mgrep[0m
              ensures  that  the  standard  input  is positioned to just after the last matching line before exiting, regardless of the presence of trailing
              context lines.  This enables a calling process to resume a search.  When [1mgrep [22mstops after [4mNUM[24m matching lines, it outputs any trailing  context
              lines.   When  the  [1m-c [22mor [1m--count [22moption is also used, [1mgrep [22mdoes not output a count greater than [4mNUM[24m.  When the [1m-v [22mor [1m--invert-match [22moption is
              also used, [1mgrep [22mstops after outputting [4mNUM[24m non-matching lines.

       [1m-o[22m, [1m--only-matching[0m
              Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line, with each such part on a separate output line.

       [1m-q[22m, [1m--quiet[22m, [1m--silent[0m
              Quiet; do not write anything to standard output.  Exit immediately with zero status if any match is found, even  if  an  error  was  detected.
              Also see the [1m-s [22mor [1m--no-messages [22moption.

       [1m-s[22m, [1m--no-messages[0m
              Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.

   [1mOutput Line Prefix Control[0m
       [1m-b[22m, [1m--byte-offset[0m
              Print the 0-based byte offset within the input file before each line of output.  If [1m-o [22m([1m--only-matching[22m) is specified, print the offset of the
              matching part itself.

       [1m-H[22m, [1m--with-filename[0m
              Print the file name for each match.  This is the default when there is more than one file to search.

       [1m-h[22m, [1m--no-filename[0m
              Suppress the prefixing of file names on output.  This is the default when there is only one file (or only standard input) to search.

       [1m--label=[4m[22mLABEL[0m
              Display input actually coming from standard input as input coming from file [4mLABEL[24m.  This is especially useful  when  implementing  tools  like
              [1mzgrep[22m, e.g., [1mgzip -cd foo.gz | grep --label=foo -H something[22m.  See also the [1m-H [22moption.

       [1m-n[22m, [1m--line-number[0m
              Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within its input file.

       [1m-T[22m, [1m--initial-tab[0m
              Make sure that the first character of actual line content lies on a tab stop, so that the alignment of tabs looks normal.  This is useful with
              options that prefix their output to the actual content: [1m-H[22m,[1m-n[22m, and [1m-b[22m.  In order to improve the probability that lines from a single file will
              all start at the same column, this also causes the line number and byte offset (if present) to be printed in a minimum size field width.

       [1m-u[22m, [1m--unix-byte-offsets[0m
              Report  Unix-style  byte  offsets.   This  switch causes [1mgrep [22mto report byte offsets as if the file were a Unix-style text file, i.e., with CR
              characters stripped off.  This will produce results identical to running [1mgrep [22mon a Unix machine.  This option has no effect unless  [1m-b  [22moption
              is also used; it has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

       [1m-Z[22m, [1m--null[0m
              Output a zero byte (the ASCII [1mNUL [22mcharacter) instead of the character that normally follows a file name.  For example, [1mgrep -lZ [22moutputs a zero
              byte after each file name instead of the usual newline.  This option makes the  output  unambiguous,  even  in  the  presence  of  file  names
              containing  unusual  characters  like  newlines.   This  option can be used with commands like [1mfind -print0[22m, [1mperl -0[22m, [1msort -z[22m, and [1mxargs -0 [22mto
              process arbitrary file names, even those that contain newline characters.

   [1mContext Line Control[0m
       [1m-A [4m[22mNUM[24m, [1m--after-context=[4m[22mNUM[0m
              Print [4mNUM[24m lines of trailing context after matching lines.  Places a line containing a  group  separator  (described  under  [1m--group-separator[22m)
              between contiguous groups of matches.  With the [1m-o [22mor [1m--only-matching [22moption, this has no effect and a warning is given.

       [1m-B [4m[22mNUM[24m, [1m--before-context=[4m[22mNUM[0m
              Print  [4mNUM[24m  lines  of  leading  context before matching lines.  Places a line containing a group separator (described under [1m--group-separator[22m)
              between contiguous groups of matches.  With the [1m-o [22mor [1m--only-matching [22moption, this has no effect and a warning is given.

       [1m-C [4m[22mNUM[24m, [1m-[4m[22mNUM[24m, [1m--context=[4m[22mNUM[0m
              Print [4mNUM[24m lines of output context.  Places a line containing a group separator (described under [1m--group-separator[22m) between  contiguous  groups
              of matches.  With the [1m-o [22mor [1m--only-matching [22moption, this has no effect and a warning is given.

       [1m--group-separator=[4m[22mSEP[0m
              Use [4mSEP[24m as a group separator. By default [4mSEP[24m is double hyphen ([1m--[22m).

       [1m--no-group-separator[0m
              Use empty string as a group separator.

   [1mFile and Directory Selection[0m
       [1m-a[22m, [1m--text[0m
              Process a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent to the [1m--binary-files=text [22moption.

       [1m--binary-files=[4m[22mTYPE[0m
              If  a  file's  data  or  metadata  indicate that the file contains binary data, assume that the file is of type [4mTYPE[24m.  Non-text bytes indicate
              binary data; these are either output bytes that are improperly encoded for the current locale, or null input bytes when the [1m-z [22moption  is  not
              given.

              By  default, [4mTYPE[24m is [1mbinary[22m, and when [1mgrep [22mdiscovers that a file is binary it suppresses any further output, and instead outputs either a one-
              line message saying that a binary file matches, or no message if there is no match.

              If [4mTYPE[24m is [1mwithout-match[22m, when [1mgrep [22mdiscovers that a file is binary it assumes that the rest of the file does not match; this is equivalent to
              the [1m-I [22moption.

              If [4mTYPE[24m is [1mtext[22m, [1mgrep [22mprocesses a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent to the [1m-a [22moption.

              When [4mtype[24m is [1mbinary[22m, [1mgrep [22mmay treat non-text bytes as line terminators even without the [1m-z [22moption.  This means choosing [1mbinary [22mversus [1mtext [22mcan
              affect whether a pattern matches a file.  For example, when [4mtype[24m is [1mbinary [22mthe pattern [1mq$ might [22mmatch [1mq [22mimmediately followed by a  null  byte,
              even though this is not matched when [4mtype[24m is [1mtext[22m.  Conversely, when [4mtype[24m is [1mbinary [22mthe pattern [1m. [22m(period) might not match a null byte.

              [4mWarning:[24m  The  [1m-a [22moption might output binary garbage, which can have nasty side effects if the output is a terminal and if the terminal driver
              interprets some of it as commands.  On the other hand, when reading files whose text encodings are unknown, it can be helpful to use [1m-a [22mor  to
              set [1mLC_ALL='C' [22min the environment, in order to find more matches even if the matches are unsafe for direct display.

       [1m-D [4m[22mACTION[24m, [1m--devices=[4m[22mACTION[0m
              If an input file is a device, FIFO or socket, use [4mACTION[24m to process it.  By default, [4mACTION[24m is [1mread[22m, which means that devices are read just as
              if they were ordinary files.  If [4mACTION[24m is [1mskip[22m, devices are silently skipped.

       [1m-d [4m[22mACTION[24m, [1m--directories=[4m[22mACTION[0m
              If an input file is a directory, use [4mACTION[24m to process it.  By default, [4mACTION[24m is [1mread[22m, i.e., read directories just as if they  were  ordinary
              files.   If  [4mACTION[24m  is  [1mskip[22m,  silently  skip directories.  If [4mACTION[24m is [1mrecurse[22m, read all files under each directory, recursively, following
              symbolic links only if they are on the command line.  This is equivalent to the [1m-r [22moption.

       [1m--exclude=[4m[22mGLOB[0m
              Skip any command-line file with a name suffix that matches the pattern [4mGLOB[24m, using wildcard matching; a name suffix is either the whole  name,
              or  any  suffix  starting  after a [1m/ [22mand before a +non-[1m/[22m.  When searching recursively, skip any subfile whose base name matches [4mGLOB[24m; the base
              name is the part after the last [1m/[22m.  A pattern can use [1m*[22m, [1m?[22m, and [1m[[22m...[1m]  [22mas wildcards,  and  [1m\  [22mto  quote  a  wildcard  or  backslash  character
              literally.

       [1m--exclude-from=[4m[22mFILE[0m
              Skip files whose base name matches any of the file-name globs read from [4mFILE[24m (using wildcard matching as described under [1m--exclude[22m).

       [1m--exclude-dir=[4m[22mGLOB[0m
              Skip  any  command-line  directory  with a name suffix that matches the pattern [4mGLOB[24m.  When searching recursively, skip any subdirectory whose
              base name matches [4mGLOB[24m.  Ignore any redundant trailing slashes in [4mGLOB[24m.

       [1m-I     [22mProcess a binary file as if it did not contain matching data; this is equivalent to the [1m--binary-files=without-match [22moption.

       [1m--include=[4m[22mGLOB[0m
              Search only files whose base name matches [4mGLOB[24m (using wildcard matching as described under [1m--exclude[22m).

       [1m-r[22m, [1m--recursive[0m
              Read all files under each directory, recursively, following symbolic links only if they are on the command line.  Note that if no file operand
              is given, grep searches the working directory.  This is equivalent to the [1m-d recurse [22moption.

       [1m-R[22m, [1m--dereference-recursive[0m
              Read all files under each directory, recursively.  Follow all symbolic links, unlike [1m-r[22m.

   [1mOther Options[0m
       [1m--line-buffered[0m
              Use line buffering on output.  This can cause a performance penalty.

       [1m-U[22m, [1m--binary[0m
              Treat  the  file(s)  as  binary.   By default, under MS-DOS and MS-Windows, [1mgrep [22mguesses whether a file is text or binary as described for the
              [1m--binary-files [22moption.  If [1mgrep [22mdecides the file is a text file, it strips the CR characters from the original file contents (to make  regular
              expressions  with  [1m^  [22mand  [1m$ [22mwork correctly).  Specifying [1m-U [22moverrules this guesswork, causing all files to be read and passed to the matching
              mechanism verbatim; if the file is a text file with CR/LF pairs at the end of each line, this will cause some  regular  expressions  to  fail.
              This option has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

       [1m-z[22m, [1m--null-data[0m
              Treat input and output data as sequences of lines, each terminated by a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of a newline.  Like the [1m-Z[0m
              or [1m--null [22moption, this option can be used with commands like [1msort -z [22mto process arbitrary file names.

[1mREGULAR EXPRESSIONS[0m
       A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings.  Regular expressions are constructed analogously  to  arithmetic  expressions,  by
       using various operators to combine smaller expressions.

       [1mgrep  [22munderstands three different versions of regular expression syntax: ‚Äúbasic‚Äù (BRE), ‚Äúextended‚Äù (ERE) and ‚Äúperl‚Äù (PCRE).  In GNU [1mgrep[22m, there is no
       difference in available functionality between basic and extended syntaxes.  In other implementations, basic regular expressions  are  less  powerful.
       The  following  description  applies  to  extended  regular  expressions; differences for basic regular expressions are summarized afterwards.  Perl-
       compatible regular expressions give additional functionality, and are documented in pcresyntax(3) and  pcrepattern(3),  but  work  only  if  PCRE  is
       available in the system.

       The  fundamental  building  blocks are the regular expressions that match a single character.  Most characters, including all letters and digits, are
       regular expressions that match themselves.  Any meta-character with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.

       The period [1m. [22mmatches any single character.

   [1mCharacter Classes and Bracket Expressions[0m
       A [4mbracket[24m [4mexpression[24m is a list of characters enclosed by [1m[ [22mand [1m][22m.  It matches any single character in that list; if the first character of  the  list
       is the caret [1m^ [22mthen it matches any character [4mnot[24m in the list.  For example, the regular expression [1m[0123456789] [22mmatches any single digit.

       Within a bracket expression, a [4mrange[24m [4mexpression[24m consists of two characters separated by a hyphen.  It matches any single character that sorts between
       the two characters, inclusive, using the locale's collating sequence and character set.  For example, in the default C locale, [1m[a-d] [22mis equivalent to
       [1m[abcd][22m.   Many  locales sort characters in dictionary order, and in these locales [1m[a-d] [22mis typically not equivalent to [1m[abcd][22m; it might be equivalent
       to [1m[aBbCcDd][22m, for example.  To obtain the traditional interpretation of bracket expressions,  you  can  use  the  C  locale  by  setting  the  [1mLC_ALL[0m
       environment variable to the value [1mC[22m.

       Finally,  certain  named classes of characters are predefined within bracket expressions, as follows.  Their names are self explanatory, and they are
       [1m[:alnum:][22m, [1m[:alpha:][22m, [1m[:cntrl:][22m, [1m[:digit:][22m,  [1m[:graph:][22m,  [1m[:lower:][22m,  [1m[:print:][22m,  [1m[:punct:][22m,  [1m[:space:][22m,  [1m[:upper:][22m,  and  [1m[:xdigit:].   [22mFor  example,
       [1m[[:alnum:]]  [22mmeans  the  character  class of numbers and letters in the current locale. In the C locale and ASCII character set encoding, this is the
       same as [1m[0-9A-Za-z][22m.  (Note that the brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic names, and must be included in addition to  the  brackets
       delimiting  the  bracket  expression.)   Most meta-characters lose their special meaning inside bracket expressions.  To include a literal [1m] [22mplace it
       first in the list.  Similarly, to include a literal [1m^ [22mplace it anywhere but first.  Finally, to include a literal [1m- [22mplace it last.

   [1mAnchoring[0m
       The caret [1m^ [22mand the dollar sign [1m$ [22mare meta-characters that respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a line.

   [1mThe Backslash Character and Special Expressions[0m
       The symbols [1m\< [22mand [1m\> [22mrespectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a word.  The symbol [1m\b [22mmatches the empty string at the edge  of
       a word, and [1m\B [22mmatches the empty string provided it's [4mnot[24m at the edge of a word.  The symbol [1m\w [22mis a synonym for [1m[_[:alnum:]] [22mand [1m\W [22mis a synonym for
       [1m[^_[:alnum:]][22m.

   [1mRepetition[0m
       A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition operators:
       [1m?      [22mThe preceding item is optional and matched at most once.
       [1m*      [22mThe preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
       [1m+      [22mThe preceding item will be matched one or more times.
       [1m{[4m[22mn[24m[1m}    [22mThe preceding item is matched exactly [4mn[24m times.
       [1m{[4m[22mn[24m[1m,}   [22mThe preceding item is matched [4mn[24m or more times.
       [1m{,[4m[22mm[24m[1m}   [22mThe preceding item is matched at most [4mm[24m times.  This is a GNU extension.
       [1m{[4m[22mn[24m[1m,[4m[22mm[24m[1m}  [22mThe preceding item is matched at least [4mn[24m times, but not more than [4mm[24m times.

   [1mConcatenation[0m
       Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular expression  matches  any  string  formed  by  concatenating  two  substrings  that
       respectively match the concatenated expressions.

   [1mAlternation[0m
       Two  regular  expressions  may  be  joined  by  the  infix  operator [1m|[22m; the resulting regular expression matches any string matching either alternate
       expression.

   [1mPrecedence[0m
       Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes precedence over alternation.  A whole expression may be enclosed  in  parentheses
       to override these precedence rules and form a subexpression.

   [1mBack References and Subexpressions[0m
       The  back-reference  [1m\[4m[22mn[24m,  where  [4mn[24m  is a single digit, matches the substring previously matched by the [4mn[24mth parenthesized subexpression of the regular
       expression.

   [1mBasic vs Extended Regular Expressions[0m
       In basic regular expressions the meta-characters [1m?[22m, [1m+[22m, [1m{[22m, [1m|[22m, [1m([22m, and [1m) [22mlose their special meaning; instead use the backslashed versions  [1m\?[22m,  [1m\+[22m,  [1m\{[22m,
       [1m\|[22m, [1m\([22m, and [1m\)[22m.

[1mENVIRONMENT VARIABLES[0m
       The behavior of [1mgrep [22mis affected by the following environment variables.

       The  locale  for  category  [1mLC_[4m[22mfoo[24m is specified by examining the three environment variables [1mLC_ALL[22m, [1mLC_[4m[22mfoo[24m, [1mLANG[22m, in that order.  The first of these
       variables that is set specifies the locale.  For example, if [1mLC_ALL [22mis not set, but [1mLC_MESSAGES [22mis set to [1mpt_BR[22m, then the Brazilian Portuguese locale
       is  used  for the [1mLC_MESSAGES [22mcategory.  The C locale is used if none of these environment variables are set, if the locale catalog is not installed,
       or if [1mgrep [22mwas not compiled with national language support (NLS).  The shell command [1mlocale -a [22mlists locales that are currently available.

       [1mGREP_OPTIONS[0m
              This variable specifies default options to be placed in front of any explicit options.  As this causes problems when writing portable scripts,
              this feature will be removed in a future release of [1mgrep[22m, and [1mgrep [22mwarns if it is used.  Please use an alias or script instead.

       [1mGREP_COLOR[0m
              This  variable specifies the color used to highlight matched (non-empty) text.  It is deprecated in favor of [1mGREP_COLORS[22m, but still supported.
              The [1mmt[22m, [1mms[22m, and [1mmc [22mcapabilities of [1mGREP_COLORS [22mhave priority over it.  It can only specify the color used to highlight the matching  non-empty
              text  in  any matching line (a selected line when the [1m-v [22mcommand-line option is omitted, or a context line when [1m-v [22mis specified).  The default
              is [1m01;31[22m, which means a bold red foreground text on the terminal's default background.

       [1mGREP_COLORS[0m
              Specifies the colors and other attributes used to highlight various parts of the output.  Its value is a colon-separated list of  capabilities
              that  defaults  to [1mms=01;31:mc=01;31:sl=:cx=:fn=35:ln=32:bn=32:se=36 [22mwith the [1mrv [22mand [1mne [22mboolean capabilities omitted (i.e., false).  Supported
              capabilities are as follows.

              [1msl=    [22mSGR substring for whole selected lines (i.e., matching lines when the [1m-v [22mcommand-line option is omitted, or non-matching lines when  [1m-v[0m
                     is  specified).  If however the boolean [1mrv [22mcapability and the [1m-v [22mcommand-line option are both specified, it applies to context matching
                     lines instead.  The default is empty (i.e., the terminal's default color pair).

              [1mcx=    [22mSGR substring for whole context lines (i.e., non-matching lines when the [1m-v [22mcommand-line option is omitted, or matching lines  when  [1m-v[0m
                     is  specified).   If  however  the boolean [1mrv [22mcapability and the [1m-v [22mcommand-line option are both specified, it applies to selected non-
                     matching lines instead.  The default is empty (i.e., the terminal's default color pair).

              [1mrv     [22mBoolean value that reverses (swaps) the meanings of the [1msl= [22mand [1mcx= [22mcapabilities when the [1m-v [22mcommand-line  option  is  specified.   The
                     default is false (i.e., the capability is omitted).

              [1mmt=01;31[0m
                     SGR  substring for matching non-empty text in any matching line (i.e., a selected line when the [1m-v [22mcommand-line option is omitted, or a
                     context line when [1m-v [22mis specified).  Setting this is equivalent to setting both [1mms= [22mand [1mmc= [22mat once to the same value.  The default  is
                     a bold red text foreground over the current line background.

              [1mms=01;31[0m
                     SGR  substring  for  matching  non-empty text in a selected line.  (This is only used when the [1m-v [22mcommand-line option is omitted.)  The
                     effect of the [1msl= [22m(or [1mcx= [22mif [1mrv[22m) capability remains active when this kicks in.  The default is a bold  red  text  foreground  over  the
                     current line background.

              [1mmc=01;31[0m
                     SGR  substring  for  matching non-empty text in a context line.  (This is only used when the [1m-v [22mcommand-line option is specified.)  The
                     effect of the [1mcx= [22m(or [1msl= [22mif [1mrv[22m) capability remains active when this kicks in.  The default is a bold  red  text  foreground  over  the
                     current line background.

              [1mfn=35  [22mSGR  substring  for  file  names  prefixing  any  content  line.   The default is a magenta text foreground over the terminal's default
                     background.

              [1mln=32  [22mSGR substring for line numbers prefixing any content line.  The default  is  a  green  text  foreground  over  the  terminal's  default
                     background.

              [1mbn=32  [22mSGR  substring  for  byte  offsets  prefixing  any  content  line.   The default is a green text foreground over the terminal's default
                     background.

              [1mse=36  [22mSGR substring for separators that are inserted between selected line fields ([1m:[22m), between context line fields, ([1m-[22m), and  between  groups
                     of  adjacent  lines  when  nonzero  context  is  specified  ([1m--[22m).   The  default  is a cyan text foreground over the terminal's default
                     background.

              [1mne     [22mBoolean value that prevents clearing to the end of line using Erase in Line (EL) to Right ([1m\33[K[22m) each  time  a  colorized  item  ends.
                     This  is  needed  on  terminals on which EL is not supported.  It is otherwise useful on terminals for which the [1mback_color_erase [22m([1mbce[22m)
                     boolean terminfo capability does not apply, when the chosen highlight colors do not affect the background, or when EL is  too  slow  or
                     causes too much flicker.  The default is false (i.e., the capability is omitted).

              Note that boolean capabilities have no [1m=[22m...  part.  They are omitted (i.e., false) by default and become true when specified.

              See  the  Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) section in the documentation of the text terminal that is used for permitted values and their meaning
              as character attributes.  These substring values are integers in decimal representation and can be concatenated with semicolons.   [1mgrep  [22mtakes
              care  of  assembling  the result into a complete SGR sequence ([1m\33[[22m...[1mm[22m).  Common values to concatenate include [1m1 [22mfor bold, [1m4 [22mfor underline, [1m5[0m
              for blink, [1m7 [22mfor inverse, [1m39 [22mfor default foreground color, [1m30 [22mto [1m37 [22mfor foreground colors, [1m90 [22mto  [1m97  [22mfor  16-color  mode  foreground  colors,
              [1m38;5;0 [22mto [1m38;5;255 [22mfor 88-color and 256-color modes foreground colors, [1m49 [22mfor default background color, [1m40 [22mto [1m47 [22mfor background colors, [1m100 [22mto
              [1m107 [22mfor 16-color mode background colors, and [1m48;5;0 [22mto [1m48;5;255 [22mfor 88-color and 256-color modes background colors.

       [1mLC_ALL[22m, [1mLC_COLLATE[22m, [1mLANG[0m
              These variables specify the locale for the [1mLC_COLLATE [22mcategory, which determines the collating sequence used to  interpret  range  expressions
              like [1m[a-z][22m.

       [1mLC_ALL[22m, [1mLC_CTYPE[22m, [1mLANG[0m
              These  variables specify the locale for the [1mLC_CTYPE [22mcategory, which determines the type of characters, e.g., which characters are whitespace.
              This category also determines the character encoding, that is, whether text is encoded in UTF-8, ASCII, or some other encoding.  In the  C  or
              POSIX locale, all characters are encoded as a single byte and every byte is a valid character.

       [1mLC_ALL[22m, [1mLC_MESSAGES[22m, [1mLANG[0m
              These  variables  specify  the  locale for the [1mLC_MESSAGES [22mcategory, which determines the language that [1mgrep [22muses for messages.  The default C
              locale uses American English messages.

       [1mPOSIXLY_CORRECT[0m
              If set, [1mgrep [22mbehaves as POSIX requires; otherwise, [1mgrep [22mbehaves more like other GNU programs.  POSIX requires that options  that  follow  file
              names must be treated as file names; by default, such options are permuted to the front of the operand list and are treated as options.  Also,
              POSIX requires that unrecognized options be diagnosed as ‚Äúillegal‚Äù, but since they are not really against the law the default is  to  diagnose
              them as ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù.  [1mPOSIXLY_CORRECT [22malso disables [1m_[4m[22mN[24m[1m_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_[22m, described below.

       [1m_[4m[22mN[24m[1m_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_[0m
              (Here  [4mN[24m  is  [1mgrep[22m's  numeric process ID.)  If the [4mi[24mth character of this environment variable's value is [1m1[22m, do not consider the [4mi[24mth operand of
              [1mgrep [22mto be an option, even if it appears to be one.  A shell can put this variable in the environment for each  command  it  runs,  specifying
              which  operands  are  the  results of file name wildcard expansion and therefore should not be treated as options.  This behavior is available
              only with the GNU C library, and only when [1mPOSIXLY_CORRECT [22mis not set.

[1mEXIT STATUS[0m
       Normally the exit status is 0 if a line is selected, 1 if no lines were selected, and 2 if an error occurred.  However,  if  the  [1m-q  [22mor  [1m--quiet  [22mor
       [1m--silent [22mis used and a line is selected, the exit status is 0 even if an error occurred.
